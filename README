# Description
A replication case for issues taking Screenshots during iPad (and only iPad) tests.

# Prerequisites
* A sane Ruby 2.x environment
* The `SAUCE_USERNAME` and `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables set
* `bundler` installed (with `gem install bundler`)

# Replicating
1. Clone this repo
2. CD into clone directory
3. `bundle install`
4. `bundle exec ruby repro.rb` to run against the iPhone
5. `DEVICE=iPad bundle exec ruby repro.rb` to run against the iPad (which fails)

The test will spin up, announce it's running and begin processing commands.
